You can add your domain into SimpleLogin and create aliases like `hi@your-domain.com`, `contact@your-domain.com`, etc.

If you don't have a domain, you can buy a domain on a domain registrar like NameCheap, GoDaddy, etc.

To add your domain, head to the [domain page](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/custom_domain) and add your domain name

You'll be directed to the domain DNS page where a small guide will walk you through setting up different DNS records.

Currently we have a guide on how to set up a domain on [NameCheap](/docs/custom-domain/registrars/namecheap/namecheap/). Guides for other domain registrars are coming up!
