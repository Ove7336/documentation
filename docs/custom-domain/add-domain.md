You can add your domain into SimpleLogin and create aliases like `hi@your-domain.com`, `contact@your-domain.com`, etc.

If you don't have a domain, you can buy a domain on a domain registrar like NameCheap, GoDaddy, etc.

To add your domain, head to the domain page at https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/custom_domain and put your domain name
