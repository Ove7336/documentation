# Troubleshooting

In case SimpleLogin emails are put into the Spam folder, you can create email filters to explicitly allow emails from SimpleLogin.

SimpleLogin **never** sends spam and no one can spoof SimpleLogin emails thanks to SPF, DKIM and DMARC protection.

However some email providers might mistakenly put SimpleLogin emails into Spam or Junk folder, especially when you start receiving emails from SimpleLogin. To mark SimpleLogin as safe senders, please follow the below guides. For information, emails coming from SimpleLogin are sent either via *simplelogin.io* or *simplelogin.co* domain.

And please do not put SimpleLogin emails into Spam. Instead, if an alias is too spammy, you can disable it on SimpleLogin dashboard.
