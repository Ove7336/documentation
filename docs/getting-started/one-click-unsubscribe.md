One-click unsubscribe (or [RFC8058](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058)) is provided by some email clients that allows you to quickly unsubscribe from a sender.

Example from ProtonMail:

From Hotmail/Outlook:

From Mac Mail.app:

All forwarded email from SimpleLogin provides this one-click unsubscribe button that allows you to stop receiving these emails by disabling the alias: clicking on the button will **disable the alias**. SimpleLogin will also send you a confirmation.

You can also choose to block the sender instead of disabling the alias by using the [One-click unsubscribe setting](http://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/setting#one-click-unsubscribe-section): this way only the sender is blocked but the alias is still active and receive emails from other senders.
