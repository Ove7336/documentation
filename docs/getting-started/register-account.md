To use SimpleLogin, you need to register an account.

To explore all features, we offer you a free 7-day trial. Apart from the limit of 15 aliases, there are no restrictions on your usage during the free trial. No credit card is required to sign up for the trial either. All aliases created during the trial are kept and continue to work normally after the trial, except from the PGP encryption which is disabled after the trial.
