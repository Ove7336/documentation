Currently we offer 50% reduction over the yearly plan for anyone working/studying in an educational institution. This reduction doesn’t have an expiration date, meaning you can benefit from it even after leaving the institution.

To apply for this program, please:

- Sign up for a SimpleLogin account with your edu address. This address usually ends up in .edu but we understand that some universities don’t have a .edu domain. You can change the account address later and/or add your other email addresses as mailboxes.

- Create a [support ticket](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/support) to obtain the discount coupon. 

Currently the only way to have the educational discount is via your edu address. In the future we will provide other verification ways.
